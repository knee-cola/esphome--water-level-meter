# Guidelines for Creating AI Agent Implementation Plans

## Purpose

This document provides instructions for AI agents on how to create comprehensive implementation plans for ESPHome projects. When tasked with implementing a feature, use these guidelines to structure your implementation approach and create actionable plans.

## Required Elements for Implementation Plans

When creating an implementation plan, ensure it includes these mandatory sections:

### 1. Project Status Tracking
- Include progress indicators: üìê Planning ‚Üí üî® Implementing ‚Üí ü©∫ Testing ‚Üí ‚úÖ DONE
- Update status as implementation progresses

### 2. Git Workflow Instructions
- Specify feature branch naming: `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
- Include branch creation and management steps
- Require commit after each logical unit of work
- Require descriptive, action-oriented commit messages

### 3. Task Breakdown and Checklist
- Create comprehensive checklist of all implementation tasks
- Break down complex features into logical, manageable steps
- Include validation steps after each major change
- Specify completion marking with (‚úÖ) checkboxes

### 4. Configuration Validation Requirements
- Mandate `./build.sh` validation after every major change
- Emphasize preservation of existing configuration parameters
- Require incremental changes to isolate potential issues

### 5. Implementation Workflow Steps
Include these specific workflow instructions in every plan:
- Project planning with comprehensive task checklist
- Git branch setup with proper naming conventions
- Implementation loop: code ‚Üí validate ‚Üí mark complete
- Status updates throughout the development process

## Mandatory Implementation Rules for All Plans

Every implementation plan must specify these non-negotiable requirements:

1. **Feature Branch Development**: All work must be done in dedicated feature branches
2. **Incremental Commits**: Require commits after each logical unit of work
3. **Build Validation**: Mandate `./build.sh` testing after each major change
4. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Unless explicitly modifying, preserve all existing behavior
5. **Progress Tracking**: Require status indicator updates and checklist completion marking during project implementation
6. **Task Completion**: Each task must be marked completed (‚úÖ) when finished
7. **Minimal Viable Solution**: Implement only the essential functionality requested - avoid adding extra logging, error checking, or monitoring unless explicitly requested by the user

## Implementation Plan Template Structure

Use this structure when creating implementation plans:

```
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

## Project Status: üìê Planning

## Project Overview
[Brief description of what will be implemented]

## Implementation Checklist

### Git Branch Setup
- [ ] Create feature branch `feature/[descriptive-name]`
- [ ] Switch to feature branch

### [Task Category 1]
- [ ] [Specific task description]
- [ ] Commit: "[Descriptive commit message]"
- [ ] Build validation: `./build.sh`

### [Task Category 2]
- [ ] [Specific task description]  
- [ ] Commit: "[Descriptive commit message]"
- [ ] Build validation: `./build.sh`

### Final Validation
- [ ] Final build validation with `./build.sh`
- [ ] Update project status to ‚úÖ DONE
